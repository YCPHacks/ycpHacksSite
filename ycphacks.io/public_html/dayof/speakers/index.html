          <h2>Talk Description</h2>
          The world is amazing! Every day there are more and more remarkable discoveries, inventions and technologies being developed. It can seem overwhelming trying to plan for every possible scenario; trying to decipher the impact each new innovation will have on our businesses, communities, and our joint future. Industries that have seemed steady and unchanged are being rocked to their core. But for those of us willing to look deeper, we will not only begin to understand the “why’s” but will see the unique and once in a lifetime opportunities hiding in emerging technologies and philosophies.  John McElligott will give us a crash course in emerging topics in technology with a focus on Robotics as well as discuss why our region here in Central Pennsylvania has not only the potential but the legacy of changing the world through Embracing Disruption.
